**ctrw** - a Continuous-Time Random Walk state-space model to filter Argos Least Squares or Kalman Filter location data

`ctrw` is an R package that fits a continuous-time random walk model in state-space form to filter Argos satellite location data. Template Model Builder (`TMB`) is used for fast estimation. The Argos data can be either (older) Least Squares-based locations or (newer) Kalman Filter-based locations with error ellipse information. Separate measurement models are used for these two data types. The model estimates two sets of location states: 1) corresponding to each observation, which are irregularly timed; and 2) corresponding to regular time intervals specified by the user. Locations are estimated and output returned on the Mercator projection.
